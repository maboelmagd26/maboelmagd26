 ## 🚀 About Me
 
### I am a Junior React Developer with nearly 1 year of professional experience contributing to 7+ large projects and 85+ pull requests at Infraalabs Ltd. I built responsive, scalable applications using React and its ecosystem, delivering authentication (MSAL & Firebase) and map-based features with OpenLayers. By optimizing React performance with memoization, bundling, and code splitting, I improved application responsiveness. Known for adapting quickly to documentation and new technologies, I apply best practices in API integration, state management, and system design to deliver maintainable code.
